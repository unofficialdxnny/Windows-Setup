# choco-addon
This is a addon to the choco-package manager forexternal downloads.(apps that arent available)

### Still In Progress

## Pros
- This program lets you install packages from `choco` 
- Allows you to download from external sources via `Requests`


## ToAdd


##  How It Works?
- There are two `text` files included with this script. `Internal` and `External`. 
- In `internal.txt` include just the names of applications included on <a href='https://chocolatey.org/'>choco website</a>
- In `external.txt` include direct download links for applications you want to download
- Run `python index.py`
- Follow instructions in `index.py`
- A file will be created as `username.py`
- When `username.py` is ran select an option :)
